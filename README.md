### Name: sosAI - AI Crisis Response System

## Summary
SosAI is an artificial intelligence that helps in crises. In a crisis situation, it is very important to act quickly, the outcome of a situation depends on it, and sometimes human life depends on it. 
SosAI gives quick support when you're feeling down or facing an emergency. It also offers friendly advice for tough moments and shows short, helpful videos in case of emergencies.

## Background:
SosAI is made to help with mental struggles and emergencies when you're all alone. It "understands" your feelings and supports you with nice words or gives simple advice (For example: if you have anxiety it can give you some meditations, breathing exercises, and asking questions to help take your mind off bad thoughts (For exemple: ask about books. Depends on your question can advise some books )). 
The idea comes from my own experience. There was a time in my life when I needed psychological help on a daily basis. But I could afford it, and I found an app that had a kind of artificial intelligence psychologist and it helped me a lot. It did not replace real psychological help but worked very well as an additional tool.

## How to use it?:
### Mental help:
Users can write what bothering them, and receive help, like, a list of exercises, meditations, Ð°rticles, books, and tests. Also asking more questions, and finding a way they can help users become quieter.
### Emergency Help:
In urgent situations like choking, SosAI watches short videos to find the part that shows what to do. It then quickly shows you just that bit, so you can act fast and save a life.

## Data sources and AI methods:
SosAI learns from mental health info and emergency tutorials, and specialists in co-operation with the University of Latvia and TSI. For talking, it uses smart reading, and for emergencies, it watches videos to find the important parts.

## Challenges:
SosAI can't replace real help from doctors or experts.
Also, a very important thing is privacy. 
SosAI will always try to give the right information and it's important to use it wisely and get professional help when needed.

## What next?:
SosAI can become better, adding more useful information, understanding more languages, and improving how it can help in emergencies. Working with experts and user reviews can help make sosAI as best friend in emergencies.
