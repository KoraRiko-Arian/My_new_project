Building AI course

### Name: sosAI - AI Crisis Response System

### Description:
SosAI is an artificial intelligence that helps in crises. In a crisis situation, it is very important to act quickly, the outcome of a situation depends on it, and sometimes human life depends on it. 
SosAI gives quick support when you're feeling down or facing an emergency. It also offers friendly advice for tough moments and shows short, helpful videos in case of emergencies.

## Background:
SosAI is made to help with mental struggles and emergencies when you're all alone. It "understands" your feelings and supports you with nice words or gives simple advice (For example: if you have anxiety it can give you some meditations, breathing exercises, and asking questions to help take your mind off bad thoughts (For exemple: ask about books. Depends on your question can advise some books )). 
The idea comes from my own experience. There was a time in my life when I needed psychological help on a daily basis. But I could afford it, and I found an app that had a kind of artificial intelligence psychologist and it helped me a lot. It did not replace real psychological help but worked very well as an additional tool.
## How to use it?:
### Mental help:
Users can write what bothering them.And
## Add:
I also want to add artificial intelligence to this so that it helps people find ways that will work with them, for example, watching some comedy programs
